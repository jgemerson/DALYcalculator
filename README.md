# DALY Calculator

## Background
Disability-adjusted life years are a measure of health loss due to disability and represent the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived in disease (YLD). 
They are used in health economics and outcomes research to determine value and effectiveness of health interventions. Considering fewer DALYs are better, health interventions aim to avert DALYs.

To make more CEA data available in standardized metrics, particularly in the DALY, we aim to develop a convenient tool that can convert health outcomes expressed in non-DALY
metrics (e.g. cases averted, deaths averted) into DALYs. Converted outcome measures could then be used to generate standardized cost-effectiveness metrics, such as cost-per-DALY averted.

This R package and Shiny App serve as analytic tools to help researchers calculate or convert efficacy and outcome metrics to Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
